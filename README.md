# Humane-Donation-at-Doorstep
Donors are not aware of the requirements of NGOs or are too busy to drive to NGO. To fill this gap between NGO and Donors we came up with a solution. Humane is an online platform which helps people get a designated place to donate books, clothes, stationery or even cash for the needy, it encourages people to donate more as they can see their efforts making a difference in the lives of the needy. The donations reach the beneficiaries as it is through a trusted partner NGOs and the donor can also keep a track on a regular basis. Users need to register to the website to make a donation. After the user has logged in the user has to give his/her donation and personal details. He/she needs to set up a pickup schedule. After we have picked up the donation the user can also track us. The website also provides opportunities for other NGOs to collaborate with us.
